### Circulatory systems

**Circulatory system** - The <span class="highlight_font">main transport system(blood system)</span> of all mammals.

**Oxygenated blood** - Oxygenated blood is simply a blood cell with a <span class="highlight_font">high proportion of oxygen</span> and a low amount of carbon dioxide.

**Deoxygenated blood** - The oxygen in oxygenated blood is taken up by the body cell. Blood that is <span class="highlight_font">low in oxygen</span> (as cells have used it) and high in carbon dioxide (as cells have produced it).

**Double circulatory system** - The blood passes through the heart <span class="highlight_font">twice</span> on one complete circuit of the body.

**Single circulatory system** - Fish have a circulatory system in which the blood passes through the heart only once on a complete circuit.

### The heart

**Atria** - The heart is divided into four spaces, called
chambers. The two <span class="highlight_font">upper chambers</span> are called atria (singular: atrium).

**Ventricles** - The two <span class="highlight_font">lower chambers</span>.

**Septum** - The tissue that separates the left and right sides of the heart and enables blood to flow as it should.

**Pulmonary veins** - Blood vessels that transfer freshly oxygenated blood from the lungs to the <span class="highlight_font">left atria</span> of the heart.
