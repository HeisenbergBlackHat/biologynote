### Circulatory systems

**Circulatory system** - The <span class="highlight">main transport system(blood system)</span> of all mammals.

**Oxygenated blood** - Oxygenated blood is simply a blood cell with a <span class="highlight">high proportion of oxygen</span> and a low amount of carbon dioxide.

**Deoxygenated blood** - The oxygen in oxygenated blood is taken up by the body cell. Blood that is <span class="highlight">low in oxygen</span> (as cells have used it) and high in carbon dioxide (as cells have produced it).

**Double circulatory system** - The blood passes through the heart <span class="highlight">twice</span> on one complete circuit of the body.

**Single circulatory system** - Fish have a circulatory system in which the blood passes through the heart only once on a complete circuit.

### The heart

**Atria** - The heart is divided into four spaces, called
chambers. The two <span class="highlight">upper chambers</span> are called atria (singular: atrium).

**Ventricles** - The two <span class="highlight">lower chambers</span>.

**Septum** - The tissue that separates the left and right sides of the heart and enables blood to flow as it should.

**Pulmonary veins** - Blood vessels that transfer freshly oxygenated blood from the lungs to the <span class="highlight">left atria</span> of the heart.

**Venae cavae** - A large vein that <span class="highlight">carries blood</span> to the heart. In anatomy, the venae cavae are two large veins (great vessels) that return deoxygenated blood from the body into the heart

**artery** - The part of your circulatory (cardiovascular) system, are the blood vessels that bring oxygen-rich blood from your heart to all of your body's cells.

**Aorta** - The first and largest artery in the body. It is responsible for transporting nutrient-rich blood to the systemic circulation following ejection from the left ventricle of the heart.


**Pulmonary artery** - The pulmonary arteries function to <span class="highlight">transport deoxygenated blood</span> from the right side of the heart to the <span class="highlight">lungs</span> for oxygenation

### Valves

**Atrioventricular valves** - The four valves in the mammalian heart are two atrioventricular valves <span class="highlight">separating</span> the upper atria from the lower ventricles. They allow blood to flow from the <span class="highlight">atria</span> into the <span class="highlight">ventricles</span> but prevent it from going in the opposite direction.


**Semilunar valves** - The valves in the entrances to the <span class="highlight">aorta</span> and the <span class="highlight">pulmonary artery</span>.

### Coronary arteries

**Coronary arteries** - Blood vessels on the outside of the heart.

**Coronary heart disease** - <span class="highlight">Blockage</span> of the coronary arteries. <span class="highlight">CHD</span> for short.

### Blood vessels

**Arteries** - Arteries, part of your circulatory (cardiovascular) system, are the blood vessels that bring <span class="highlight">oxygen-rich blood</span> from your heart to all of your body's cells.

**Capillaries** - Capillaries, very tiny vessels, deliver blood containing oxygen and nutrients close to every cell in the body. No cell is very far away from a capillary.

**Veins** - Blood vessels located throughout your body that collect oxygen-poor blood and return it to your heart

**Hepatic artery** - Hepatic artery supplies the liver with oxygen-rich arterial blood.

**Hepatic portal vein** - This vein brings blood from the digestive system, so that the liver can process the food which has been absorbed, before it travels to other parts of the body.

**Hepatic veins** - All the blood leaves the liver in the hepatic veins.


### Blood

**Plasma** - The liquid part of blood is called plasma.
